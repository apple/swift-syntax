# Swift Syntax 601 Release Notes

## New APIs

- `FunctionDecl`, `InitializerDecl`, `SubscriptDecl`, `EnumCaseElement`, and `MacroDecl` gained a new computed property: `symbolName`
  - Description: The `symbolName` property provides a string representation of the declaration's name along with its parameter labels. For example, a function `func greet(name: String)` will have the symbol name `greet(name:)`.
