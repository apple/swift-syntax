/// tree that are "active" according to a particular build configuration,
/// meaning that the syntax would contribute to the resulting program when
/// when compiled with that configuration. For example, given:
///
/// ```
/// #if DEBUG
///   #if os(Linux)
///    func f()
///   #elseif os(iOS)
///    func g()
///   #endif
/// #endif
/// ```
///
/// And a build targeting Linux with the custom condition `DEBUG` set, a
/// complete walk via this visitor would visit `func f` but not `func g`. If
/// the build configuration instead targted macOS (but still had `DEBUG` set),
/// it would not visit either `f` or `g`.
///
/// All notes visited by this visitor will have the "active" state, i.e.,
/// `node.isActive(in: configuration)` will evaluate to `.active` or will
/// throw.
///
/// TODO: This visitor currently swallows errors uncovered while checking `#if`
/// conditions, which is deeply unfortunate. We need a better answer here.
